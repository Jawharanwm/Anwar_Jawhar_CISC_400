Line 1 defines the code block under is going to be written in javascript all inside 
    a HTML file.

Line 3 creates a varriable called canvas which will be manipulated with javascript
    webgl is our identifer and by using getelementid, we fetch it through the HTML element.

Line 5 creates a varriable called gl which basically gets the rendering context for WebGL by calling our canvas up

Line 6-8 is essentially checking if we succesfully get the nesscesary rendering context.
    if we do it passes this check, if not it throws a error to our console and returning.

Line 11-13 is another check seeing if we had correctly intialized the gl varriable with
    both shaders. if it passes this check it throws no errors. if initshaders results as false
    it will throw a error to our console.

Line 15 is basically closing our script block in the HTML file.
