Pixel - 
    A pixel is the smallest individual unit of an image or display. 
    It’s a tiny dot of color that, when combined with many other pixels, forms a complete picture or screen display.

Frame (or refresh) buffer- 
    A frame buffer is a part of computer memory that holds the image data that is being displayed on the screen at a given moment. 

Aliasing and Antialiasing- 
    Aliasing occurs when an image appears jagged or pixelated, especially along the edges of objects, 
    due to the limitations of resolution and pixel size.

    Antialiasing is a technique used to smooth out those jagged edges by blending the colors of the edge pixels,
    making the transitions between them appear more gradual

Bit map and pixel map-
    Bitmap is a type of image file format where each pixel in the image is mapped to a specific bit of data, 
    defining the color or intensity of that pixel.

    Pixel map refers to the arrangement or layout of pixels in a display, 
    showing how individual pixels correspond to points in the image or the output

Resolution- Resolution refers to the number of pixels in an image or display, usually measured as width × height (e.g., 1920×1080).
 It defines the level of detail an image can show — higher resolution means more pixels, leading to sharper images.

Bit Depth (or color depth)-

    Bit depth refers to the number of bits used to represent the color of each pixel. A higher bit depth means more colors can be displayed. For example, 
    an 8-bit color depth allows for 256 colors, while 24-bit allows for over 16 million colors, resulting in more accurate and vivid images.
