Difference between a Vertex Shader and a Fragmant Shader

Vertex Shader-
    The main purpose is for geometric transformations and 
    vertex-level calculations

    The stage in pipeline is early for a vertex processing

    It handles more simpler operations such as matrix transformations

    It influences where the geometry appears on the screen

Fragmant Shader-
    The main purpose is per-pixel coloring, texturing,
    and shading

    Stage in the pipeline is more towards later for fragment processing

    It handles more complex effects such as lighting, shading,
    and texturing

    It influences what color each pixel appears as
