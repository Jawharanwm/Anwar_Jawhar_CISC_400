Our vertex shader is a attribute that recieves 
the position that it will be located at. Then passed to the shader.

Our Fragment shader on the other hand has more math involved. Getting a floating point uniform varriable for the 
canvas's width and height. "gl_FragCoord gives the fragmentâ€™s coordinates, which are normalized to create a gradient effect across the triangle."
gl_fragcolor is setting each pixel a color based on its position, red varries with the x-coordinates and blue with the y-coordinates.


Main function is the same as always, initializing shaders, writing the positions of verticies,
clearing the canvas then drawing.

initvertexbuffers is similiar to what we have seen before instead with the new addition of the widith and height varriables for the canvas.
then binding the drawing buffers for it.
